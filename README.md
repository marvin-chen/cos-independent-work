## Predicting Pokémon Type and Generation Using Machine Learning Techniques - Work in Progress
The approach is to develop an advanced multi-modal, multi-output classification model for predicting both Pokémon type and generation. This novel approach integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing with dense layers for analyzing tabular data, specifically the Pokémon's basic statistics. The model's architecture is designed to produce two distinct outputs: one for Pokémon type classification and another for generation prediction.
