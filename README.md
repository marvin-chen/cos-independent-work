## Predicting Pok√©mon Type and Generation Using Machine Learning Techniques 
This project focuses on predicting Pokemon types and generations using various machine learning models. So far I have implemented and compared several algorithms to classify Pokemon based on their stats and characteristics.
### Project Overview
Data: I am using a dataset of Pokemon with features like HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Height, and Weight. The dataset is scraped from https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all. 

#### Prediction Tasks:
- Primary Type Prediction
- Both Types Prediction (Multi-label classification)
- Generation Prediction

### Models Implemented
I have experimented with several machine learning models so far:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Random Forests
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM) - both linear and RBF kernels
5. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

### Methodology
For each model, the general implementation steps are as follows:
1. Data preprocessing and splitting
2. Initial model training without cross-validation
3. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
4. Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, Hamming loss, and classification reports
5. Feature importance analysis
